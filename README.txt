# ChainRights: Decentralized Game Marketplace #
## Version 1.0 ##
ChainRights is a transformative blockchain solution aimed at decentralizing the game marketplace. Utilizing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, ChainRights offers on-chain game licensing, empowering both users and game developers with a fully decentralized platform.
### Features: ###
* On-chain Game Licensing: Secure and transparent licensing of games on the blockchain.
* Decentralized Game Marketplace: A marketplace where users can freely buy, sell, and trade game licenses.
* Empowerment of Users and Developers: Users gain true ownership of their digital games, and developers receive royalties from resales.
## Smart Contracts ##
The ChainRights ecosystem is comprised of three smart contracts:
* Token (CRI.sol): Manages the custom cryptocurrency (CRI tokens), allowing for minting, transferring, and approving tokens.
* GameRegistry (GameRegistry.sol): Handles game registration, game license management, and developer staking requirements.
* SalesContract (SalesContract.sol): Facilitates the purchasing and selling of games, including on-chain game licensing and resale of game licenses.\
